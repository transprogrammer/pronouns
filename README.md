For as the twoheaded amphisbaina in very sooth winds the coils between and spits her poison from either mouth

rolling along and along with double-gliding motion

and head crawling joins with head while she jumps about with twirling waves of her back sideways

so that magnificent necklace twisted shaking its crooked back, with its pair of curving necks

which came to meet at the midnipple, a flexible twoheaded sperent thick with scales

and by the curving joints of the work the golden circle of the moving spine bent round

until the head slid about with undulating movement and belched a mimic hissing through jaws
